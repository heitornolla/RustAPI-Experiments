# Rust CRUD API

I was studying a bit of API development through FastAPI and decided to turn that into an oportunity to learn another language. As a (mainly) Python developer, I picked Rust, since I'm aware it is used in some Data Engineering pipelines and embedded systems, but I also wish to learn Go and Typescript in the future.
