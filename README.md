# Rust CRUD API

I was studying a bit of API development through FastAPI and decided to turn that into an oportunity to learn another language. As a (mainly) Python developer, I picked Rust, since I'm aware it is used in some Data Engineering pipelines and embedded systems, but I also wish to learn Go and Typescript in the future.

I'm building the Rust API and the Postgre database inside of Docker containers.

Check out [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vhNoiBOuW94&list=PLKzy2v2SJ-e7j5zFg7TTMAL240O-Yb5ti&index=23) for a fantastic hands-on introduction to Rust APIs.
